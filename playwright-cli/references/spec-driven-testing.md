# Spec-driven testing (plan → generate → heal)

End-to-end workflow for authoring and maintaining Playwright tests using `playwright-cli`. The three sections below can be used independently:

- **Planning** — explore the app, produce a spec file describing what to test.
- **Generate** — turn a spec into Playwright test files. Update the spec if it's vague or stale.
- **Heal** — diagnose failing tests, fix the code, reconcile the spec with reality.

All three lean on the same mechanic: run `npx playwright test --debug=cli` in the background, then `playwright-cli attach tw-XXXX` to drive the paused page interactively. See [playwright-tests.md](playwright-tests.md) for the debug/attach mechanics and [test-generation.md](test-generation.md) for how every `playwright-cli` action emits Playwright TypeScript.

---

## 1. Planning

Goal: produce a spec file (e.g. `specs/<feature>.plan.md`) that enumerates the scenarios to test. **Always** write the spec to a file.

### 1.1 Prerequisite: workspace

Check the workspace has Playwright installed before anything else:

```bash
# Either of these confirms a workspace:
test -f playwright.config.ts || test -f playwright.config.js
npx --no-install playwright --version
```

If there is no Playwright install, bootstrap one and let the user pick the defaults:

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

### 1.2 Prerequisite: seed test

A **seed test** is a minimal test that lands the page in the state every scenario starts from: navigation to the app, any required login, feature flags, etc. Scenarios assume a fresh start *after* the seed. `--debug=cli` pauses *inside* this test, so the seed is where every planning and generation session begins.

Minimum viable seed:

```ts
// tests/seed.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('seed', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com/');
});
```

Preferred — push navigation into a fixture so scenario tests reuse it:

```ts
// tests/fixtures.ts
import { test as baseTest } from '@playwright/test';
export { expect } from '@playwright/test';

export const test = baseTest.extend({
  page: async ({ page }, use) => {
    await page.goto('https://example.com/');
    await use(page);
  },
});
```

```ts
// tests/seed.spec.ts
import { test } from './fixtures';

test('seed', async ({ page }) => {
  // Fixture already navigates. This empty body tells agents where to start.
});
```

If no seed exists, create one that at least navigates to the app.

### 1.3 Explore the app

Launch the app via the seed in the background and attach:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN=never npx playwright test tests/seed.spec.ts --debug=cli
# wait for "Debugging Instructions" and the session name tw-XXXX
playwright-cli attach tw-XXXX
```

Resume so the seed runs, then probe the app:

```bash
playwright-cli resume                   # resume so that seed test runs fully
playwright-cli snapshot                 # inventory of interactive elements
playwright-cli click e5                 # follow a flow
playwright-cli eval "location.href"     # read URL / state
```

Map out:

- Interactive surfaces (forms, buttons, lists, filters, modals).
- Primary user journeys end-to-end.
- Edge cases: empty states, validation errors, very long input, boundary values.
- Persistence: reload, local/session storage, URL fragments.
- Navigation: which controls change the URL, back/forward behaviour.

**Important**: Do not just open the app url with playwright-cli, always go through the test to capture any custom setup done there.
**Important**: Stop the background test when done exploring.

### 1.4 Write the spec file

Save under `specs/<feature>.plan.md`. Use this structure:

```markdown
# <Feature> Test Plan

## Application Overview

<One paragraph describing what the feature does and why it matters.>

## Test Scenarios

### 1. <Group Name>

**Seed:** `tests/seed.spec.ts`

#### 1.1. <kebab-case-scenario-name>

**File:** `tests/<group>/<kebab-case-scenario-name>.spec.ts`

**Steps:**
  1. <Concrete user step>
    - expect: <observable outcome>
  2. <Next step>
    - expect: <outcome>
```

Guidelines:

- Each scenario is independent and starts from the seed's fresh state — never chain scenarios.
- Scenario names are kebab-case and match the test file name.
- Steps are concrete user actions, not implementation details.

---

## 2. Generate

Turn each spec scenario into a Playwright test file.

```bash
# Launch seed in debug mode
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN=never npx playwright test tests/seed.spec.ts --debug=cli
playwright-cli attach tw-XXXX
playwright-cli resume

# Walk through the scenario, generating code
playwright-cli fill e1 "test@example.com"
playwright-cli click e3
# Each action prints generated TypeScript
```

Collect the generated code into the test file specified in the spec.

---

## 3. Heal

When tests fail, use `--debug=cli` to attach and diagnose:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN=never npx playwright test tests/failing.spec.ts --debug=cli
playwright-cli attach tw-XXXX
playwright-cli resume   # run until it fails

# Inspect current state
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli eval "document.title"
```

Fix the locators or logic in the test file, then re-run to confirm.
